Once upon a time, in faraway land called Javaton, there was a hero named Mac.
Mac could type faster than anybody in the land, but he was always competing with his arch nemesis, Dell.
One day, the two had a great duel in the Computer Sciences lab, and they both absolutely destroyed the lowly peasant Jake, 
who was a mediocre coder that was way out of his league.

Then the cs professor Larry busted through the cs lab to challenge the evil DELL. 
Dell was no match for the far stronger and better cs professor. 
Mac saw Larry over the beaten Dell as he ripped out his processor.

Larry became king of all cs labs and quickly became a dictator. Mac was fed up with Larrys power and challenged
him to a duel. Winner becomes king of the cs labs. Through a hard fought coding battle, Mac came out victorious
and restored peace throughout all the labs.

The rest of the followers of DELL start to leave the cs labs and settle themselves down in a place called Business hall.
They tried to restore their power in this shelter and get revenge one day for DELL.
